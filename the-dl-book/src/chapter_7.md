```admonish abstract title="Chapter Guide"
**What you'll reflect on:** Honest retrospective on what worked, what was hard, and what you'd do differently.

**What you'll cover:** Async Rust lessons learned, BitTorrent complexity, protocol abstraction value, debugging async race conditions, performance benchmarks, future improvements.

**End state:** The complete journey documented. By-the-numbers summary (LOC, protocols, time spent), trade-offs made, areas for improvement, and encouragement for others to build their own.
